Users can now draw multiple annotations simultaneously, enhancing creative flexibility. Furthermore, every action, including customizations, will be tracked in the undo/redo collection, ensuring a seamless user experience and making it easier to experiment with different designs. The Image Editor component also provides z-order support, allowing users to adjust the positioning of annotations. This feature is particularly useful for designing personalized templates like greeting cards or posters, where managing the layering of multiple annotations is crucial for a polished final product. Additionally, the Image Editor component has an enhanced save feature. Users can now save an image with a specified file name, file type, and image quality, providing more control over the output and ensuring that users can save their work exactly as they need it." }
